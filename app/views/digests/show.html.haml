%h3 What does this mean?
%p
  This page shows the first time we've registered anyone accessing a particular digest. It therefore proves the existence of the content that generated the digest was created at the latest on 
  =@stamp.utc
  :plain
    . It may have been available before this time, however TimeCert does not know this.
%h3 What is a digest
%p
  A Digest is the result of a mathematical function called a Hash Algorithm, see
  =link_to "WikiPedia","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function"
  to learn more. The function creates a unique "fingerprint" known as a digest for any given piece of data such as an invoice, a blog post or a patent application. Changing any part of the data including punctuation will give you a different digest. Try it yourself on the 
  =link_to "TimeCert Digest Generator","/generate"
  page. TimeCert uses an industry standard one way function called
  = link_to "SHA1","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1"
  which provides a pretty good balance of speed and security.
